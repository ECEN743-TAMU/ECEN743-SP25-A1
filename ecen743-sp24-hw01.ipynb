    "## Introduction of the FrozenLake Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Frozen lake involves crossing a frozen lake from start to goal without falling into any holes by walking over the frozen lake. The player may not always move in the intended direction due to the slippery nature of the frozen lake. The game starts with the player at location [0,0] of the frozen lake grid world with the goal located at far extent of the world e.g. [3,3] for the 4x4 environment. Holes in the ice are distributed in set locations using a pre-determined map, and the player makes moves until they reach the goal or fall in a hole. The map is given below for your reference\n",

    "    \n",
    "### Action Space\n",
    "The player/agent can take 4 discrete actions, in the range {0,3}\n",
    "* 0: Move left\n",
    "* 1: Move down\n",
    "* 2: Move right \n",
    "* 4: Move up\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### State Space\n",
    "The environment consists of 16 states. The state is a value representing the playerâ€™s current position as current_row * nrows + current_col (where both the row and col start at 0).\n",
    "For example, the goal position in the 4x4 map can be calculated as follows: 3 * 4 + 3 = 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting State\n",
    "The episode starts with the player in state [0] (location [0, 0]).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Rewards \n",

    "* Reach goal: +1\n",
    "* Reach hole: 0\n",
    "* Reach frozen: 0\n",
    "\n",
    "### Episode End\n",
    "The episode ends if the following happens:\n",
    "#### 1.Termination:\n",
    "* The player moves into a hole.\n",
    "* The player reaches the goal at max(nrow) * max(ncol) - 1 (location [max(nrow)-1, max(ncol)-1]).\n",

    "* Use discount factor, $\\gamma = 0.9$\n",
    "* The environment is slippery, ie., the transition kernel is stochastic.\n",
    "* The transition kernel P is a dictionary. \n",
